            What is the difference between map, filter, find and forEach?
          </h1>
          <p>
            Map and filter create new arrays, find returns the first element
            that satisfies a condition, and forEach performs an operation on
            each element of an array without creating a new array or returning
            any value.

            What is the difference between local-storage session-storage and a
            cookie?
          </h1>
          <p>
            Local storage, session storage, and cookies are different mechanisms
            for storing data in web browsers, each with its own advantages and
            use cases. Local storage and session storage are typically used for
            larger amounts of client-side data that is accessed by JavaScript
            code on a specific website, while cookies are more commonly used for
            smaller amounts of data that need to be shared across different
            domains or accessed by server-side scripts. Cookies also have
            built-in expiration times, can be automatically sent to the server,
            and are subject to certain security vulnerabilities, whereas local
            storage and session storage are not automatically sent to the
            server, do not have built-in expiration times, and are generally
            considered more secure.

            What is event loop in JavaScript and how it works?
          </h1>
          <p>
            The event loop in JavaScript is a mechanism that allows for handling
            asynchronous events and managing concurrent execution of code. It
            uses an event queue, a call stack, and callbacks to ensure that
            events are processed in an orderly manner without blocking the main
            thread of execution. Understanding how the event loop works is
            crucial for writing efficient and responsive asynchronous code in
            JavaScript.
